# FUDScan: The Ultimate FOMO/FUD Risk Scanner

## Ethos
Turn every investor and degen into a professional FUD-buster. Make due diligence accessible, quick, and meme-powered. Let anyone scan whitepapers, websites, and teams for risk and red flags, all with AI speed, on-demand, and live across their favorite chat platforms. Make the market smarter, one FUD scan at a time.

## Alpha Thesis
"Don't get ruggedâ€”get FUD. Every project brings the hype, FUD brings the facts. Scan first, FOMO never."

## The Team
- RugRadar (AI/LLM Lead, ex-Chainalysis)
- CrunchAI (Data pipelines, deep Crunchbase/Github wrangler)
- SnipeTheSuits (Team risk investigator, OSINT ninja)
- Memeposter (Viral marketing, FUD meme lord)
- Real auditors and KYC experts as network partners

## Project Details

### Introduction
**FUD Token** is the world's first all-in-one crypto, web3, and tech project scanner bot that does what every investor and trader wishes they had time for: **INSTANT AI DUE DILIGENCE**. Drop any whitepaper, smart contract address, or even a project website, and FUD bot goes deep:

- Runs advanced scam and ponzi pattern recognition
- Cross-references founders, funders, and previous history with Crunchbase, GitHub, LinkedIn, court databases
- Assigns a "FUD Index"â€”our proprietary risk, hype, and trust score
- Summarizes that project's FOMO/FUD factors for your group, your friends, or your wallet
- Alerts you to past rugpulls, recycled code, or identity swaps
- Generates meme breakdowns and shareable risk Snapshots
- Works seamlessly in Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, and custom chat bots.

### How It Works
1. **Paste/Upload**: A whitepaper, contract address, or website link.
2. **AI FUD Scan**: The bot parses for hidden red flags, risky mechanics, copy-paste code, unusual team histories, known scams.
3. **Cross-Platform Diligence**: Connects the dots in real-time: founder LinkedIns, court records, Crunchbase, previous projects, and wallet behavior.
4. **FUD Index**: Get a clear "FUD Meter" score plus a meme-powered summary ("99% pump, 78% chance of rug, 4% actual use-case").
5. **Personalized Reports**: Get full breakdowns, alerts, and compare projectsâ€”back up your DYOR with real facts, not just vibes.
