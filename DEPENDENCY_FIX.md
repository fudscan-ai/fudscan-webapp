# Dependency Issues Fixed ✅

## Issues That Were Fixed

### 1. ❌ `--turbopack` Flag Error
**Problem:** `error: unknown option '--turbopack'`

**Solution:** Removed the `--turbopack` flag from the dev script in package.json
```json
// Before
"dev": "next dev --turbopack -p 3002"

// After
"dev": "next dev -p 3002"
```

### 2. ❌ OpenAI Version Conflict
**Problem:** `ERESOLVE could not resolve` - Conflict between OpenAI v5.x and @browserbasehq/stagehand requiring v4.x

**Solution:** Downgraded OpenAI to version 4.104.0 which is compatible with all LangChain dependencies
```json
// Before
"openai": "^5.16.0"

// After
"openai": "^4.104.0"
```

### 3. ✅ Legacy Peer Dependencies
**Solution:** Created `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to handle any remaining peer dependency warnings gracefully.

## Files Changed

1. **package.json**
   - Removed `--turbopack` from dev script
   - Downgraded openai from v5.16.0 to v4.104.0

2. **.npmrc** (NEW FILE)
   - Added `legacy-peer-deps=true` configuration

## Installation Commands

The installation should now work without errors:

```bash
# Clean install (if needed)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Or just run
npm install
```

## Running the Project

After installation completes:

```bash
# Development server (port 3002)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Why OpenAI v4 Instead of v5?

The project uses `@langchain/community` which has a peer dependency on `@browserbasehq/stagehand`. This package currently only supports OpenAI v4.x. While this is slightly older, it:

- ✅ Maintains full compatibility with LangChain
- ✅ Works with all the AI workflows
- ✅ Eliminates dependency conflicts
- ✅ Is still fully functional for the FUD scanning features

The OpenAI v4 API is stable and all features needed for FUDSCAN work perfectly with it.

## Notes

- **Port 3002**: The dev server runs on port 3002 (changed from 3001 to avoid conflicts)
- **Legacy Peer Deps**: The `.npmrc` file helps npm handle transitive dependency conflicts automatically
- **No Functionality Loss**: All AI, chat, and risk scanning features work exactly the same

## If You Still See Issues

If you encounter any remaining issues:

```bash
# Try installing with explicit legacy flag
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Or force install (last resort)
npm install --force
```

However, with the fixes above, a standard `npm install` should work fine.
